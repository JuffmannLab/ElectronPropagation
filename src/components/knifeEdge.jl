    calculate!(wave.:Wave, edge::Edge)

Calculate the effect of the knife edge.

This function calculates the impact on the wavefunction of `wave`
from a knife edge that is define by the `edge` object. In the edge
object there is an offset saved, that can be added, and that will
offset the knife edge from the middle of the coordinate system with
`edge.offset` number of pixels.
